# React App - Basic Info Display

This is a simple React app created to demonstrate fundamental React concepts, including the use of state, props, and components.

## Features

- **Very Easy**: Display a `div` with hard-coded personal information inside the `render` method.
- **Easy**: Create a `constructor` that takes `props`, calls `super()`, and sets up the `this.state` object to store a `person` object.
- **Medium**: Replace the hard-coded data with data from `this.state.person`, then pass the state into a new `BasicInfo` component.
- **Hard**: Modify the app to display a list of peopleâ€™s information using an array stored in state. Each person's information is rendered in a `BasicInfo` component.
